## About DecodedPapers

Welcome to DecodedPapers — where I share insights on AI/ML papers and books. As an AI/ML practitioner, I break down complex research into digestible practical implementations, showing you not just the theory but how to bring these ideas to life with code.

Here, you'll find:

- Step-by-step reproductions of state-of-the-art papers.
- Real-world adaptations that demonstrate how theoretical concepts can solve practical problems.
- Deep dives into implementation details that papers often gloss over.

Whether you're a researcher, an engineer, a data science beginner, or just curious about the bleeding edge of machine learning, DecodedPapers bridges the gap between academic research and practical application. All code is available on GitHub, allowing you to experiment, extend, and build upon these implementations for your own projects.


## About Me

Hi, I'm Mayer Antoine

I'm a data scientist, public health informaticist, and computer scientist fascinated by how technology solves real-world problems—especially applied AI/ML in public health and production ML systems.

* 🔭 I'm currently a Data Scientist at the CDC, helping public health professionals upskill and implement AI/ML solutions. My work spans predictive modeling, NLP, patient matching algorithms, big data analytics, data visualization and generative AI systems.

* 🔨 I build tools, proof of concepts, and tutorials that modernize health systems. Check out [duplicategenerator](https://github.com/mayerantoine/duplicategenerator) (synthetic data generation for record linkage), [cdc-text-corpora](https://github.com/mayerantoine/cdc-text-corpora) (public health text datasets), [injury narrative coding](https://github.com/mayerantoine/injury-narrative-coding-transformers) (NLP for medical coding), and [patient matching](https://github.com/mayerantoine/matching-comparative-review) (probabilistic record linkage algorithms).

* 📚 I advance AI/ML capabilities across CDC through technical consultation, problem-solving, and creating learning materials that bridge research and real-world application.

* 🎓 Graduate of the Public Health Informatics Fellowship Program (PHIFP) and Georgia Tech's MSc in Computer Science.

* 💡 I love projects at the intersection of AI/ML research and healthcare impact.
